# odin-recipes
First project for Odin Fundamentals

This is a simple project for the fundamentals of html.
The project consists of an index.html and 3 recipe pages.
I've stylised the project using a modest amount of css.

I've refreshed and updated my knowledge of html (previous version I used was 3.2).
